# Friend_Finder

Frispace is an application that allows users to complete a survey and matches you with the person who's responses closely match. The user and the friend are linked, with a pop-up message that posts the new friend. The user can also view all users inputs through the API friend list tab and a link to the creator's code through the GithubRepo link on the home page.
